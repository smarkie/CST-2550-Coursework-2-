This is a 2nd coursework project for the module CST 2550
It contains a simple Car Parking System structured by linked list.

The pdf document contains a presentation of why I chose linked list and also displays my reasoning on this selection.
It contains my thoughts, limitations and what I could possibly improve in the future for a similar or alternate project.

To run the files, have all the files downloaded and after going in that directory, run " ./output " via the terminal to run the program.
